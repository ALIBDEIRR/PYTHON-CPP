# PYTHON-CPP
An interface to enter the parameters used in a cpp code manually from the interface without the need to change them from the code every time

The interface has also build , make , and run buttons that uses the os and subprocess libraries in python to  build ,make and run a cpp code.

The cpp code is not supported in this repository because the work is confedential , but the py code gave us  a clear idea of how we can uses a tkinter graphical user interface GUI to enter parameters of different types int, double and boolean , store them in a text file and then compile the cpp code.

There is also a file named read_from_text.cpp , it shows how the values are read ffrom the text file in the cpp code.
